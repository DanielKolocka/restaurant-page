# restaurant-page
This repository contains a single-page application for a fictional restaurant, created as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course. The goal of this project was to master DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering all of the website's content, including images and text, using JavaScript alone.

The site is structured with a tabbed navigation menu, allowing users to seamlessly switch between the Home, Menu, and Contact pages. Webpack was used to manage module dependencies and bundle the final project files for deployment.
